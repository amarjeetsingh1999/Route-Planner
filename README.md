# Route-Planner

## Overview
A route-planning algorithm like the one used in Google Maps to calculate the shortest path between two points on a map.
Implements A* search algorithm which uses greedy Best-First-Search using a heuristic to guide itself.

## File Details
* helpers.py - Helper functions for loading and displaying the map.
* map-10.pickle - A sample map with 10 nodes.
* map-40.pickle - A sample map with 40 nodes.
* project_notebook.ipynb - Jupyter notebook containing all the steps followed.
* student_code.py - The main algorithm implementation resides here.
* test.py - Contains function with test cases for testing the route planner implementation.
